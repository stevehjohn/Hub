Before Release:
- Mechanism to handle scenario where connection credentials aren't available - Ming should ask for them and store for the session
- Licensing - especially trial version (maybe no need to be heavy handed on licensed copies being oversubscribed)

- Send close message to all tab documents when app closed (e.g. so console processes are terminated)

- Website to email notifications when feedback is sent


Other To Do:

- Tab, up and down arrows to move between editable properties on collection view
- Backup/Restore. db.fsyncLock(), copy data files, db.fsyncUnlock(). How to copy the files from a remote machine?

In Progress:
- Show Mongo statistics
  - Add detail view - collection sizes and locks?
  - Select which memory chart to view?
  - Filter the operations chart?
- CnnInfo to provide friendly name method which uses the friendly name or host:port is no friendly name set. Tab titles shoud use this.

TEST EVERYTHING!

Low priority:
- Automatically remove successful items from the operation list (after a configurable period)
- Rename document properties?
- Make copy collection more efficient?
- Refresh treeview after copying collections (or copying each collection). Or, any background operation which can effect the treeview.
- Options dialog (with plugins)
- Copy document
- Delete document property
- Add document property

Difficult:
- Embedded console? (see http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/335909/Embedding-a-Console-in-a-C-Application)

Other ideas:
- Import/export
